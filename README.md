# Cine World

Welcome to Cine World, a comprehensive platform for movie enthusiasts. This project was realized as part of the "Programming for the Web" course during the 2023 - 2024 academic year. It builds upon a previous school project developed on the **[Code.org](https://codeprojects.org/projects/weblab/oWZ1sXb3rGhatqboFaIh56AwPL4HncKjDDGfZTJVnk8/)** platform. The original project consisted solely of the frontend component, which has now been extended to include a fully functional backend, offering a more complete and robust application.

Cine World offers a variety of functionalities including movie reviews, the latest news, movie ratings, and upcoming premieres. Users can also share the project via a QR code linking to the GitHub repository. The project aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for movie lovers to explore and share information about their favorite films.
