If we relate concepts like "semantic load" and "entertainment" to different poles of cinema, undoubtedly, the works of the Coen brothers would sit right in the middle. Their signature humor, combined with a rare ability to create intelligent films without sacrificing entertainment, has allowed the brothers to shine brightly in the vast universe of cinema since the 90s. It's worth noting that regardless of whose favorite directors' list the names of these renowned brothers appear on, their fitting into the cinematic landscape is rarely questioned. And if you consider the Coens' work solely through the aforementioned lens—though there could be a dozen such lenses for their filmography—you inevitably conclude that "No Country for Old Men" is the quintessence of the brothers' work.
"No Country for Old Men" is a philosophical parable set against the backdrop of a psychological thriller. In fact, this phenomenon is quite unique because it is rare for an author to convey the serious issues through action-packed narratives. Engaging both intellectual and visual processes equally, the Coens completely erase the feeling that you are merely watching a movie and not experiencing the harsh reality of our times. A two-hour suspense builds silently, creating tension with the barely audible breaths of the characters, making you flinch at every rustle, knock, and clang without any intrusive music. The overall ambiance of the Wild West, where every grain of sand blown by the wind is one of the hundreds of insignificant details that build the authenticity of the picture. The complete absence of clichés typical of the genre and the resolutions that exceed all conceivable and inconceivable bounds of cynicism and harshness towards the audience. By intensifying the degree of brutality to the limit and refraining from irony and mockery, the Coens, against the backdrop of three characters, practically reflect modern society, which at first glance may seem entirely exaggerated.
The change of generations, the distancing from any moral values, where compassion is no longer scattered about, where cruelty and cynicism reign supreme. War veteran Llewelyn Moss, who accidentally stumbles upon a suitcase neatly packed with green bills, unknowingly attracts pure evil in human form. The military discipline and intelligence that allowed him to fight on equal terms with the emotionless and cold-blooded Chigurh were no match for his kind heart, that echo of old morals to which the Coens give no chances. And the old sheriff Bell, who, not understanding how his times passed so quickly, can do nothing with the growing madness. He just spreads his hands and remembers the old days, overthrown literally before his eyes. And only the pain, the heart-wrenching pain, and the sadness reflected in his eyes remain...
In the end, the Coens, without excessive moralizing, simply showed what we have become, while simultaneously crafting a benchmark thriller that could have easily stood on its own without the underlying idea and would still be highly impressive. But by perfectly combining form and content, the brothers essentially created an impregnable construction that is objectively difficult to approach. Because the adapted novel has become much more subtle and refined, not attempting to serve everything to the viewer on a silver platter, stimulating thought processes and all the nuances found in the Coens' signature dialogues polished to a shine. And if the wild thought of criticizing does creep in and manifests as complaints about the tediousness of the elderly monologues, rest assured, the courteous brothers will politely point you to the title.
