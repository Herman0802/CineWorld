What is life in a madhouse? Inadequacy and madness. What is our life? The same. We are presented with a social issue within the framework of a lunatic asylum. Essentially, by observing what seem to be insane people at first glance, the familiar system we know so well gradually unfolds—a modern model of society.
When someone in society emerges who can drastically influence the general situation with their differing opinion, the disturbed participants react to the hero in various ways. People like McMurphy are the missing links in our society; they can lead a crowd and reveal something more in a person than what appears at first glance. In short, a true personality. Finding himself among a crowd of lunatics while not being one himself, the natural reaction was one of misunderstanding.
Entering the psychiatric hospital in a somewhat unconventional way, he stirs up the entire facility with his eccentric behavior and rebellious tendencies, blatantly disregarding the rules, thereby inciting the wrath of the nurse, who plays the role of the "voice of reason," enforcing false justice and putting every patient in line.
Dictatorship, schedules, restrictions—aren’t these familiar conditions? And if you oppose the system, they will inevitably break you. You really start to hate Louise Fletcher’s character during the viewing, and you begin to empathize with the fates of the mentally ill. It then becomes clear that they are merely victims of public opinion. They are dependent, frightened, and, of course, incapable of taking control of their lives, subjected to the pressure of those who are morally stronger.
The further process of "survival" becomes the establishment of something important and authoritative for the crowd, which happens within the hospital walls. McMurphy, who awakens excitement and even a semblance of interest in the patients, fueled solely by his own activity, takes responsibility for all the antics that contradict discipline, increasing the already significant conflict between him and the nurse. This, by the way, has escalated into personal animosity between these two people, serving as the motivation for the finale.
It’s hopeless if you view it through the eyes of a realist, comical if you see it through McMurphy’s eyes. There are few people like him. Anyone who tries to step out of the general herd becomes a public enemy. Why, pray tell? F. Petrarch
