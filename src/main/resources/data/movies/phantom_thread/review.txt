Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the few cinematic prodigies who has made a name for himself with complex auteur works, which always become events in the world of major cinema. He always carefully selects the themes for his new projects, writes the screenplay himself, and completely controls the filming process. His stories are always original and radically different from one another. However, they often explore similar issues. This is also true for his latest work, "Phantom Thread," which once again confirms the director's talent.
While watching the film, it feels like an adaptation of a famous novel from the past, but in reality, it is an original story born in the mind of Paul Thomas Anderson. The film tells the story of a famous couturier with the colorful name Reynolds Jeremiah Woodcock, who is a true master of his craft, dressing socialites, movie stars, and other celebrities. His life follows strictly established rules, with no room for excesses or deviations. But everything changes with the arrival of a simple girl from the countryside. At first glance, the film appears to be a standard love story, but it is not. It is a deep and rich life drama with an unconventional love line, where nothing goes by the rules.
Paul Thomas Anderson, as always, touches on a broad range of issues in the film. His favorite theme, the institution of family and the complexity of family relationships, is fully explored here. An adult bachelor, averse to the joys of family life, a domineering, strict sister (an old maid), and a headstrong young lover. The clash of these characters provides interesting material for psychological analysis. The image of the mother and her influence on the protagonist is also significant. Behind the strong personality of a strict professional hides a vulnerable soul in need of emotional warmth.
The film brilliantly recreates the atmosphere of 1950s London. The director spent a lot of time studying the fashion of that historical period. The interiors, costumes, cars, and streets all correspond to the realities of that era. The visual design is done in a retro style, with the film maintaining a grainy texture. The musical accompaniment by Jonny Greenwood, the lead guitarist of Radiohead, is also noteworthy.
The lead role is played by the outstanding British actor Daniel Day-Lewis, a devotee of the Stanislavski system who always fully immerses himself in the role, often at the expense of his own health. Here, too, he completely absorbed himself in the character, learning to sew and mastering the intricacies of high fashion. His refined manner of speech, facial expressions, and gestures captivate the viewer's attention and do not let go. He magnificently portrays the complex nature of his character. His muse is played by the young actress Vicky Krieps, who has an allure but also something repellent about her.
"Phantom Thread" is a deep and subtle existential drama, a monumental auteur film in which a delicate love story, a power struggle, an exploration of the creator's life, and an ironic perception of everyday reality are wonderfully intertwined. The atmosphere completely immerses us in the world of gothic London in the 1950s. This is thoughtful intellectual cinema that is not for everyone. But those who appreciate complex psychological constructs will find this original film interesting.
