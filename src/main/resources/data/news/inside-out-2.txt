Pixar's "Inside Out 2" is poised for a monumental opening weekend, potentially becoming the biggest box office hit of 2024. Projections estimate a domestic opening of $85 million and an additional $50 million internationally, totaling $135 million for the opening weekend. This would surpass current record-holder "Dune: Part Two," which opened with $82.5 million domestically.
The sequel revisits Riley's emotions, introducing new characters like Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui, reflecting her journey through adolescence. The original "Inside Out," released in 2015, was both a critical and commercial success, grossing $858.8 million worldwide and winning an Oscar for Best Animated Feature.
Early reviews are positive, and industry experts believe strong word-of-mouth could help "Inside Out 2" achieve long-term success. This release is crucial for Pixar, as recent films have underperformed post-pandemic. If projections hold, "Inside Out 2" could be a major boost for the studio and a highlight for movie theaters in 2024.
